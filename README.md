# DAD-DATC-Project
DAD-DATC is a team project for an online voting system that has two components as follow: a Web application and a mobile application. 
The back-end part and the Web app are made by two of my collegues and the mobile app is done by me.
This repository includes only the mobile application developed using Java and Android Studio.
