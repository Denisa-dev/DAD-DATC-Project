# DAD-DATC-Project
DAD-DATC is a team project for an online voting system that has two components as follow: a Web application and a mobile application. <br>
The back-end part and the Web app are made by two of my collegues and the mobile app is done by me.<br>
This repository includes only the mobile application developed using Java and Android Studio. <br>
By using this application, the user can vote for presidential elections and not only, in Romania.
